# Logipix

Logipix Project

——————

To solve a Logipix problem, you must execute the main method of the “Test” class (which uses all the other classes in the src folder). 

Test : 

 Logipix problems to be solved : file - Examples
The name of this text file must be written in the instantiation of the Logipix object of the “Test” class ("name.txt").

The program returns "true" if the puzzle has a solution (otherwise "false") and displays this solution in another window. It also displays in the console the time required to calculate the solution.

To speed up the representation of the solution, pass the "slow" method in the "solve()" function of the Logipix class as a comment.
